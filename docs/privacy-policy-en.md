# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-11-09

Welcome to "ABB Robot Program Reader" (the "App"), operated by the individual developer Heartbeat. We currently do not collect personal or device data. This policy describes our baseline data practices and how future changes will be communicated. Because the App is available globally (including the EU), we refer to GDPR principles even though no personal data is processed at present.

## Information We Collect
At this time, the App does NOT collect:
- Device information (model, OS version, identifiers)
- Crash / error logs via third-party SDKs (none integrated)
- Usage analytics or behavioral tracking
- Location data
- Advertising identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID)
- Other sensitive categories (accounts, contacts, precise location, etc.)

If future versions introduce such features, we will update this policy and provide in-app notice or consent options before collection begins.

## Use and Sharing
Since no personal data is collected, there is no ongoing processing or sharing.
If in future anonymized diagnostics or usage metrics are introduced, they would only be used for:
- Performance and stability improvements
- Feature quality assessment
- Debugging and issue resolution

We do not sell personal data. Any future sharing would occur only as required by law or through necessary technical hosting of static pages.

## Third-party Services / SDKs
None integrated at present ("none"). If later added (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics, Analytics), we will:
- List each service with a link to its policy; and
- Provide appropriate notice / consent mechanisms in-app.

## Permissions
The App may request file access permissions solely for selecting and reading ABB robot program files. It does not request high-risk permissions such as location, camera, microphone, or background tracking.

## Children's Privacy
The App is intended for technical/industrial use and is not specifically directed to children. Minors should use it only with parental or guardian consent and guidance.

## Data Retention and Security
No personal data is retained. If future collection is introduced, tentative retention examples (subject to update):
- Crash logs: 90 days
- Aggregate analytics: up to 12 months
All collection would follow data minimization and necessity principles, with reasonable safeguards.

## Your Rights
Since no personal data is processed, data subject requests (access, correction, deletion, withdrawal of consent) are not currently applicable. If processing is introduced, you may exercise rights by emailing us or via in-app settings.

## International Compliance (GDPR, etc.)
Serving a global audience including the EU means that if personal processing begins later, we will:
- Identify lawful bases (e.g., consent, legitimate interest);
- Support data subject rights (access, erasure, portability, restriction, objection);
- Address cross-border transfer safeguards where relevant.

## Changes to This Policy
We will update this page and revise the "Last updated" date if data collection or third-party services are introduced. Significant changes may be highlighted in-app.
